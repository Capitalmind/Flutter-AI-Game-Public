# 🏆 Flutter AI Tournament System

## Overview

The Flutter AI Tournament System implements a **dynamic elimination-based evolution** where AI personalities compete across multiple games in a browser session. Weaker performers are gradually eliminated and replaced with fresh challengers until only the strongest personalities remain.

## 🎮 Tournament Mechanics

### First Game in Session
- **Completely random AI personality selection**
- All 16 available AI personalities can be chosen
- No performance history influences selection
- Fresh start for every new browser session

### Subsequent Games in Session
- **Elimination Mode** automatically activates
- **Worst performing AI** (lowest final net worth) is eliminated
- **New challenger** randomly selected from unused personalities
- **Surviving AIs** retain their positions for the next game
- Process continues until only 2 personalities remain

## 🧠 Personality Evolution Logic

### Performance Tracking
```javascript
// Game results tracked for each personality:
{
    playerId: "yellow",
    companyName: "Fairfit Furniture Company", 
    personalityKey: "day_trader",
    personalityName: "Day Trader",
    personalityEmoji: "⚡",
    finalNetWorth: 450,
    finalCash: 200,
    finalShareValue: 250,
    isWinner: false
}
```

### Elimination Algorithm
1. **Rank all players** by final net worth (descending)
2. **Identify worst performer** (lowest net worth)
3. **Mark personality for elimination** (cannot return to arena)
4. **Select random replacement** from unused personality pool
5. **Update session storage** with tournament progress

### Replacement Selection
- Prioritizes **never-used personalities** first
- If all personalities tested, **reintroduces eliminated ones**
- Ensures variety and prevents personality stagnation
- Random selection maintains unpredictability
