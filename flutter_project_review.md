## 🧠 AI Strategy Implementation

### Risk Profile System
Each AI has distinct characteristics affecting:
- **Risk Tolerance** (0.3-0.8): Willingness to hold volatile positions
- **Diversification Preference** (0.3-0.8): Portfolio spreading vs concentration
- **Cash Reserve Target** (0.1-0.4): Liquidity management
- **Buy/Sell Thresholds**: Price levels triggering action

### Decision Matrix
```
Market Analysis
├── Price Level Assessment (undervalued → overvalued)
├── Technical Momentum (traveler vs parent position)
├── News Risk Evaluation (proximity to triggers)
├── Dividend Potential (distance to payout positions)
└── Competitive Ranking (relative performance)

Strategic Decision
├── Selling Priority (overvalued + high risk)
├── Buying Opportunities (undervalued + low risk)
├── Cash Management (reserve targets)
├── Risk Mitigation (anti-slump usage)
└── Market Timing (news anticipation)
```

### Example AI Behaviors
- **Conservative** (Yellow): Maintains 40% cash, sells at £150, diversifies widely
- **Aggressive** (Red): Keeps 10% cash, holds until £180, concentrates positions
- **Contrarian** (Green): Buys during panics, sells during euphoria

## 🎮 Game Features & Mechanics

### Trading System
- **Broker-mediated trading** with limited certificate supply
- **£5 brokerage fee** on purchases (no selling fees)
- **Turn-based trading** (only before dice roll per Rule 8a)
- **Market price execution** based on parent peg positions

### Market Events
- **Automatic card reshuffling** when deck exhausted
- **Random card selection** maintaining unpredictability
- **Company-specific effects** targeting affected company
- **Insurance card management** with automatic usage

### Game Progression
- **Multiple cycles** possible with configurable targets
- **Bonus share resets** allowing market cycling
- **Bankruptcy elimination** reducing player count
- **Survival victory** if only one company remains

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Bugs
1. **Share initialization phantom values** - players sometimes start with 1 share each
2. **Peg placement inconsistency** - occasional visual positioning errors
3. **Auto-play speed scaling** - may need fine-tuning for very high targets

### Technical Limitations
- **Single-threaded execution** - no async game state management
- **No persistence** - games lost on browser refresh
- **Limited scalability** - designed for 3-6 players only
- **Browser storage restriction** - cannot save game state locally

### Design Constraints
- **Artifact environment** - cannot use external APIs or libraries
- **Single-file architecture** - all code in one HTML file
- **No server integration** - purely client-side implementation
