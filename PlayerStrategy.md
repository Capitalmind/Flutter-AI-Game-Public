The 1971 Spears **Flutter – The Stock Exchange Game** is a light economic board game simulating stock market speculation, designed for families and casual players.

## 🧠 Strategic Elements in *Flutter* (Spears, 1971)

### 🎲 Game Basics (Known or Inferred)

* Players act as investors on a fictional stock exchange.
* They buy and sell shares in various companies (each represented by cards or tokens).
* Market prices fluctuate due to **“Market News” cards**, drawn randomly during the game.
* Players attempt to increase their **net worth** by the end of the game (cash + value of shares).

## 🧭 Core Strategic Axes

### 1. **Market Timing**

* **Key Idea**: Anticipate upswings or downturns caused by Market News cards.
* **Strategy**:

  * Diversify holdings unless you're confident a certain company is “due” for good news.
  * Sell high and rebuy during downturns.
  * Watch for patterns if cards are shuffled back in rather than discarded.

### 2. **Risk vs Safety**

* **Aggressive play**: Invest heavily in one or two stocks hoping for positive Market News.
* **Conservative play**: Maintain a broad portfolio and focus on steady growth.
* **Counter Strategy**: If players are dumping a stock, that might be your opportunity—unless a major negative card is still in play.

### 3. **Bluffing & Observation**

* **Multi-player advantage**: Track opponents’ buying/selling habits.
* Bluff by selling good stock to mislead others about an impending crash.
* Pay attention to groupthink; following the herd might help—but only if you know when to get out.

### 4. **Liquidity Management**

* Always keep enough **cash on hand** to:

  * Buy low when others panic.
  * Avoid being forced to sell during downturns.
* Don’t overinvest early in illiquid assets unless a Market News boost is likely.

### 5. **Card Counting (if replayed decks)**

* If Market News cards are **reshuffled**, tracking played cards becomes viable:

  * For example, if "Premises Damaged by Fire" has already occurred for Company A, it may be less risky.
  * If "Bonus Dividend" has not yet shown for Company B, loading up might be strategic.

## 💡 Simple Example Strategies

### 🐂 Bullish Gambler:

* Invest heavily in one company early on.
* Hope for “Company Receives Big Contract” or “New Product Successful”.
* Huge gains if it pays off. Bankrupt if hit by “Foreign Competition” or “Flood”.

### 🐻 Defensive Investor:

* Keep holdings split across 3–5 stocks.
* React to card draws each round and trade based on dips and spikes.
* Low variance, solid win chance in 4+ player games.

### 🎭 Insider Bluff:

* Watch which company someone is quietly accumulating.
* Mimic or counter-play: inflate its price then crash it via sell-off.
* Very effective with 5+ players and open negotiation.

## 🏁 Endgame Positioning

* Watch the **deck size**: if you know the end is near, sell volatile assets.
* Cash is king in final tally—convert vulnerable stocks into banknotes unless you’re confident they’ll rise once more.
