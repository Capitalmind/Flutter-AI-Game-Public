## **FLUTTER**

**STOCK EXCHANGE GAME FOR 3 TO 8 PLAYERS AGE 10 TO ADULT. FUN FOR HOURS ON END**

### **THE IDEA OF THE GAME**

Each player starts with £300. The player tries to make a further profit by drawing dividends and by buying and selling shares in trading companies.
There are six companies irrespective of the number of players. Players do not choose a company (or peg). The only way a player can obtain an interest in a company is by buying its shares. Players may invest heavily in one company or spread it over several companies if they wish.
The player alone decides the dividends from the shares he owns and the fluctuations in the share values (just as in real life). Frequently during the game, players may see which shares are likely to rise and which to fall in the immediate future and may buy or sell accordingly. For instance, they can sell a share likely to rise, sell it high, rebuy it cheaper later.
“Market News Cards,” however, may upset their calculations. The game is thus a mixture of luck and skill and good fair game.

### **RULES OF THE GAME**

#### **1. Broker**

The players first choose someone to act as broker. If there are more than four players he will usually be too busy to play as well. For a simulation, this will be the computer.

#### **2. The Pegs**

These are composite and consist of:

* **Traveller Peg**
* **Parent Peg**

The traveller peg moves up the board according to the throw of the dice. Its position after each round determines the dividend paid, if any (see Rule 11).
The parent peg indicates the current market price of 100 shares by its position on the board. It also serves as the starting point from which the traveller peg operates and to which it returns after each round (see Rule 11).
Each pair of pegs represents a trading company. It has the same colour as its lane on the playing board and its company’s share certificates.

#### **3. Money Tokens**

The broker issues £300 made up of two £100 tokens, one £50, one £20, one £10, two £5 to each player at the start of the game. He keeps the rest of the money for paying out dividends.

#### **4. “Market News” Cards**

At the start of the game these cards are shuffled thoroughly and placed face downwards near the board.

#### **5. The Game Board**

The broker holds for each company as many share certificates as there are players, 100 shares being the value of each certificate at game commencement hence 100 par on the board - (this could be changed later to a lower starting value, but game play continues and value increases, explained later). Example: If there are 4 players the broker holds 4 certificates for each of the six companies. He also keeps a record of who owns what share values (just as in real life).

#### **6. Market Price of Shares**

The price shown in the centre row of the board, level with a company’s parent peg, is the current market price of 100 shares in that company.

#### **7. Starting the Game**

The parent pegs, topped by their respective traveller pegs, are placed in their lanes on the board opposite “PAR 100” share value.
Players throw the numbered die to decide who will start; the player throwing the highest number starts. The others follow clockwise. The players in turn throw both dice. The colour die indicates which company is affected, the **TRAVELLER PEG** of this company being moved up the board by the number of spaces shown on the numbered die. For example, if white is thrown, the white traveller peg for **CAPTIVATING COSMETICS LTD.** is moved four holes up the board and the dice are passed to the next player for his throw.

### **8. Buying and Selling of Shares**

* (a) A **PLAYER MAY ONLY BUY OR SELL SHARES IMMEDIATELY BEFORE HE THROWS THE DICE.**
* (b) Shares may only be bought or sold in hundreds or multiples; each share certificate represents 100 shares.
* (c) The broker will sell only shares **HE HAS AVAILABLE** at their market price shown on the board, against the company’s parent peg, plus £5 per certificate for brokerage, stamp duty, etc.
* (d) The broker will buy any shares offered to him at their market value as shown on the board, without any fees, and keep them for resale.
* (e) Players may only buy or sell shares through the broker.

---

### **9. Market News**

* (a) When a traveller peg moves into a hole opposite **“MARKET NEWS”** the top card of the pile marked “MARKET NEWS” is turned up and its instructions carried out. These refer only to the particular company to which the traveller peg belongs. The card is then replaced face downwards at the bottom of the pile.
* (b) When a traveller peg moves into a hole marked **“M”**, it moves up the board to the hole opposite **“MARKET NEWS”**, a card is turned up and its instructions carried out, as if the traveller peg landed there in the first place.

---

### **10. Slump**

When a traveller peg moves into a hole opposite “SLUMP” it drops back 6 holes automatically.

---

### **11. Dividends and Fluctuations in Share Prices**

As soon as a traveller peg reaches or exceeds the top of the board, the round is ended. The game is halted while the broker pays out the dividends and moves the parent pegs, thus altering the market value of the shares.

Dividends are always payable on **£100 PAR value**, *not* on the market price.

| Position of Traveller Peg                             | Broker pays Dividends on each 100 shares | Broker moves Parent Peg         |
|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Top of board 20%                                       | £20                                      | 2 spaces up                      |
| Opposite 10%                                           | £10                                      | 1 space up                       |
| Opposite 5%                                            | £5                                       | 1 space up                       |
| Opposite Slump (in possession of anti-slump card)      | £10                                      | 1 space up                       |
| Opposite Market News                                   | —                                        | Not at all                       |
| Below Market News                                      | —                                        | 1 space down                     |
| Still on Parent Peg                                    | —                                        | 2 spaces down                    |


The broker will find it convenient to attend to each company separately and as soon as he has paid the claims of its shareholders for dividends, he should return the traveller peg to the parent peg and then move both up or down as directed above.
The broker can thus see at a glance which companies he has already dealt with and which he has not.
When all dividends have been paid and the parent pegs moved and **THE TRAVELLER PEGS REPLACED ON THE PARENT PEGS**, the **MARKET NEWS** cards are shuffled and the game continues as before.
The person next to the player who threw the dice last in the previous round throws the dice first in this round.

---

### **12. Bonus Shares**

When a **PARENT** peg is moved up to the £200 share level, the company capitalises its reserves and issues bonus shares free of charge on a one-for-one basis. This lowers the market value of the shares to £100.
In other words, the broker gives each shareholder an additional certificate (taken from the game’s cards under Rule 5) for each certificate already held, and moves the company’s parent peg into the hole opposite the **“PAR 100”** share value.

**Note:** If there are more than 6 players, the banker may not have sufficient certificates to meet this issue, in which case he pays all the shareholders in cash at the rate of £100 per 100 shares. Bonus shares are equal in all respects to ordinary shares.

---

### **13. Bankruptcy**

When a parent peg reaches the bottom of the board (i.e., when a company becomes bankrupt), the parent peg and its traveller are removed from the board and the company ceases trading for the rest of the game. Its shares have no value.

---

### **14. Winner of the Game**

The game is won by the player who first increases his capital (i.e., money and shares valued at market prices) to **£600** or an agreed upper limit.
It is a player's own responsibility to claim to have won. This claim can be made **ONLY after the broker has paid out all dividends and moved the parent pegs during one of the periodic stoppages of the game**.
If more than one player claims to have won, the one having the most shall be the winner. It is the duty of the broker to check all claims and declare the winner.
